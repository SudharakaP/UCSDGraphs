# Advanced Data Structures in Java
This repository contain the work I have done with regard to the **Advance Data Structures in Java** course in Coursera under the specialization, **Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures**. The final project consist of a map application which can output the optimal route between two cities using one of Breadth First Seach, Dijkstra's or A-Star Algorithm.

### Importing Project into eclipse:
- Create a new Java Project in your workspace
- Import the starter files:
- File -> Import -> Select "File System" -> Next -> Browse and set root directory to folder contents of zip were extracted to -> Finish
